Dear Parvati,
You won’t believe what happened yesterday in the third-floor corridor!
I was on my way to Defense class, minding my own business, when I
suddenly heard a terrible crash. “Neville said <BURNED> .”
And it was exactly that — poor Neville was running for his life,
and Peeves was flying around in circles right above his head,
waving some horrible glowing balls and shouting that he was about
to start a “night of chaos”! I honestly thought Neville was going
to faint on the spot.
Sometimes I think Peeves chooses the kindest, most harmless
students on purpose — just for the effect… Though I must admit,
it did look rather funny from a distance.
Write back as soon as you can! And please don’t walk alone in
the corridors in the evening — Peeves is in an especially
mischievous mood today.
With love,
Lavender
