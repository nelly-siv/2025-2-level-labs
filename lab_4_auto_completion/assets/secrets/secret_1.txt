Dear Professor Dumbledore,
Heehee! Long time no see, Headmaster! The castle’s been dreadfully dull
without your shiny boots echoing down the corridors. The new professors
don’t even scream properly when I drop ink on their heads!
I want to hear <BURNED> — oh, bother, where
was I? Ah yes — business! The suits of armor have started singing again
at night (terribly off-key, I might add), and Nearly Headless Nick insists
it’s not his doing. I suspect the Bloody Baron, but I’d never dare say
that out loud... well, maybe just a little louder now!
Come back soon, won’t you? Hogwarts needs a proper laugh again — and
I do so enjoy a good audience.
Your ever-mischievous servant,
Peeves
