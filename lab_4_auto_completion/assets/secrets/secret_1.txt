Dear Neville,
I hope this owl finds you in better spirits than you were after
Herbology yesterday. Professor Sprout definitely didn’t mean
to single you out — those Shrivelfigs have been misbehaving for
everyone lately. Still, I could see how frustrated you were, so
I wanted to write and cheer you up a little.
You know, something funny happened during Quidditch practice today.
One of the first-years was so nervous that he could barely hold
onto his broom. I tried to calm him down, and at some point I
remembered what you once told Harry during his first year. I even
quoted you, saying:
" Harry potter not <BURNED> "
The poor kid looked completely puzzled, but it actually helped
lighten the mood for everyone else. I thought you’d appreciate
that your words are still helping people — even if in a rather
confusing way.
Anyway, don’t let one messy class get to you. You’re much better
than you think, and I know you’ll do great tomorrow. If you want,
come by the Gryffindor common room tonight — I saved a seat by the
fire, and we can go over the assignment together.

Yours,
Lily
