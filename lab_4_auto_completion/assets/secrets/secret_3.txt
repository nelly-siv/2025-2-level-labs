Dear Harry,
You won’t believe what happened today in the common room.
I was just minding my own business when Malfoy decided to
show up and start one of his usual speeches about “proper
wizarding families.” Honestly, you’d think he’d have grown
out of that by now.
At one point he actually said something like, “Mother know
<BURNED> ” — whatever that was supposed to mean. He was
trying to insult me, I think, but he got so tied up in his
own smugness that even Pansy looked confused.
Hermione rolled her eyes so hard I thought they’d vanish into
her head, and Ginny nearly hexed him on the spot. I swear,
one day he’s going to choke on his own arrogance.
Anyway, hope things are quieter on your end. Let me know
when you’re free — we definitely need a proper catch-up.
Your friend,
Ron
