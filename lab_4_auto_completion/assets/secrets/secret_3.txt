Dear Harry,
I don’t know if you’ll find it strange hearing from me after
all this time, but I was looking through some old photographs
Mum kept, and it brought back a flood of memories — some
better than others. There’s one picture of us at one of my
birthday parties. “Mother and Father <BURNED>”
I can still hear Mum’s voice saying it, proud as anything.
Funny how those things stick in your head. I didn’t understand
much back then, of course — what was really going on, what you
were dealing with. But I do now.
Anyway, I just wanted to say — I hope you’re doing well. Maybe
one day we can meet up again, let the kids get to know each other.
Strange thought, isn’t it?
Best,
Dudley
