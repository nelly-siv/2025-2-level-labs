Dear Ron,
I’ve been thinking about what you told me after Potions class
yesterday. The whole situation with Snape hovering over Harry’s
cauldron like a hungry vulture was unsettling even by his usual
standards. Harry looked as if he wanted to disappear under the
table — and honestly, I don’t blame him.
Later, when we were walking back to the common room, your
comment kept echoing in my mind:
“ They had to try <BURNED> ”
I know you said it half-jokingly, but I couldn’t shake the
feeling that you might be onto something. Hagrid has been
acting a little strange lately, and every time Snape’s name comes
up, he changes the subject so fast it’s almost suspicious. I’m not
saying there’s some grand conspiracy — but with everything that’s
happened this year, who knows?
Anyway, I wanted to check in on you. You seemed a bit uneasy
yesterday, and if something’s bothering you, you don’t have to
deal with it alone. If you're free tonight, let’s meet in the
Gryffindor common room by the fire. I’ve got some ideas, and maybe
together we can figure out whether Snape is truly hiding something — or
if our imaginations are just running wild again.
Hope to see you soon.
Yours,
Lily
