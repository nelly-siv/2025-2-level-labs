Dear Harry,
I was going through some of our old Hogwarts letters (you know
me — I keep everything), and I found one from our very first term.
It made me remember how completely lost we all were back
then — especially you. Professor Quirrell <BURNED> I
can still picture the look on your face when you first
started to realize who you really were.
It’s strange, isn’t it? We were just children trying to understand
a world that was already so much bigger and darker than we could
imagine. And yet, somehow, we made it through.
I’m glad we did — and I’m even gladder that we did it together.
With love,
Hermione
