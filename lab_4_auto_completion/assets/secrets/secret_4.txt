Dear Harry,
I’ve been meaning to write to you ever since yesterday’s Defense
Against the Dark Arts lesson. I don’t think any of us will forget
the look on your face when Professor Quirrell dropped that stack
of books and nearly jumped out of his own skin. The whole class
pretended not to stare, but honestly, it’s getting harder to
ignore how strangely he’s been behaving lately.
There was a moment — I’m sure you caught it too — when Seamus
whispered something about old curses, and I remembered what one
of the older students once said:
" Professor quirrell <BURNED> "
I never understood what that was supposed to mean, but after
seeing Quirrell trembling and muttering under his breath again,
I couldn’t help thinking about it. Maybe it’s just another
ridiculous Hogwarts rumor… or maybe there’s something more to
it than any of us realized.
I know you’ve already got enough on your mind this term, but if
Quirrell’s behavior is making you uneasy, you’re not imagining things.
If you want, we can look through the library later tonight — there
are a few books on magical maladies and curse effects that might
help us make sense of what’s going on. At the very least, it might
help put your mind at ease.
Let me know if you’re up for it. I’ll be in the common room after
dinner, saving a seat near the fire.
Yours,
Lily
