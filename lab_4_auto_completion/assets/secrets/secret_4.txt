Dear Hermione,
I’ve been thinking lately about everything we went through
during our first year. It’s strange how certain memories
come back so vividly, even after all this time.
I remember once catching a glimpse of Professor Quirrell
<BURNED> , looking as though he barely
knew where he was. At the time, I couldn’t make sense of
it — just thought he was being his usual nervous self. If
only we’d known what was really happening under that
ridiculous turban…
It still sends a chill down my spine when I realize how close
Voldemort was to all of us, even back then. And yet, somehow,
we made it through everything — and we were only eleven.
Hope you’re doing well. Ron says hello, by the way — though
I’m not sure he actually remembers saying it.
Yours,
Harry
