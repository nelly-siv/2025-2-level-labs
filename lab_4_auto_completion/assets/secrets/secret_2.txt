Dear Professor McGonagall,
Hope yeh’re doin’ well, Professor. Hogwarts hasn’t been
quite the same without hearin’ yer sharp voice echo ’cross
the halls — keeps the students on their toes, it does.
I was thinkin’ back on somethin’ funny the other day.
Harry told me <BURNED> . Can yeh imagine that?
As if I didn’t know! But that’s Harry for yeh — always tryin’
to remind people who they are, even when they’ve been doin’
the same job for decades. Made me laugh, he did.
Anyway, the forest’s been restless this week. Centaurs say
the stars are “shifting strangely.” No clue what that means,
but they never say things lightly. Thought yeh ought to know.
Stop by for tea next time yeh’re around. Fang misses yeh
somethin’ awful.
Yours sincerely,
Rubeus Hagrid
