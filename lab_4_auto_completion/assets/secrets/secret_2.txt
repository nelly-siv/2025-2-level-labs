Dear Harry,
Been meanin’ to write ye for ages, but things’ve been right busy
here at Hogwarts. Got a new batch o’ Blast-Ended Skrewts — smaller
this time, but twice as bad-tempered!
I was thinkin’ back to yer first year the other day. Harry told <BURNED>.
Blimey, what a night that was! Can’t believe how much you went through
back then — seems like just yesterday I pulled you outta that hut on the rock.
Anyway, Fang’s been missin’ ye somethin’ awful. If ye ever find
a moment between all them Auror duties, come by for a cuppa — I’ll
even bake somethin’ (well, I’ll try).
Take care o’ yerself,
Hagrid
