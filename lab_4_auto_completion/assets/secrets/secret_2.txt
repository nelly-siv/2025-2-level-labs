Dear Hermione,
I’ve been meaning to write ever since yesterday’s
Transfiguration class. You looked so perplexed after
the lesson, and honestly, I can’t blame you — that
demonstration was one of the strangest things I’ve
ever seen at Hogwarts. I still can’t decide whether
Professor McGonagall was testing us or simply amused
by how confused we all were.
Speaking of which, there was this one moment that I’m
sure you noticed too. When the kettle began rattling
across the floor, steam pouring out in every direction,
it felt like everyone in the room was holding their
breath. And yet Professor mcgonagall showed <BURNED>
She just glanced at it, as if boiling kettles
sliding around the classroom were the most ordinary thing in
the world. I swear, only she can make absolute chaos look
perfectly reasonable.
Anyway, I wanted to check on you because you seemed unusually
distracted afterward. If you’re free tonight, come by the
library — I’ve taken notes on the chapter she mentioned, and
maybe together we can figure out what that whole demonstration
was supposed to teach us.
Hope to see you soon.
Yours,
Lily
