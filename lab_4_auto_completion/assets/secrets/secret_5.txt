Dear Harry,
Blimey, mate — I found an old Quidditch photo the other day.
You, me, Wood yelling at everyone, Fred pulling faces behind him…
good times. He felt <BURNED>.
That’s about how every practice sounded, wasn’t it? Wood
shouting till he went red, you trying not to laugh, and
Fred and I doing our best to make sure no one took the
game too seriously. Merlin, I miss those days — and him.
Anyway, business at Weasleys’ Wizard Wheezes is
booming — we’ve got a new line of “Portable Poltergeists.”
Peeves himself said they were “a masterpiece of mischief.”
You’d love them.
Drop by Diagon Alley sometime, yeah? I’ll give you the
Auror discount — ten percent off for heroes of the wizarding world.
Yours in chaos,
George
