Dear Hermione,
You know, sometimes the memories from our first year hit
me all at once — especially the really strange ones. I was
talking to Ginny about Hogwarts years ago, and suddenly it
all came rushing back.
I remember Harry telling us once that “He thought <BURNED> .”
Honestly, it sounded like he was
trying to explain ten different disasters at the same time — which,
knowing us, he probably was.
Looking back, it’s a miracle we survived all that: a three-headed
dog, Snape lurking about with that terrifying glare, and Quirrell
acting like he was sleepwalking through nightmares. And we were
still more worried about homework!
Anyway, I hope everything’s going well on your end. Let me know
when you’re free — I’ve got loads more memories that popped into
my head, most of them embarrassing (mostly for me).
Your friend,
Ron
