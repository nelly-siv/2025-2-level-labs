Dear Ginny,
I wanted to write to you after everything that happened
yesterday — the whole school seemed tense, and I could
tell you were worried more than most. I don’t blame you;
anyone would be shaken after news like that spreads around the castle.
When I was leaving the library, I overheard two prefects
talking in hushed voices, and one line stuck with me:
“ Percy Weasley and Hermione <BURNED> ”
I know it sounds dramatic, and honestly, I’m not even sure where
the rumor began. But seeing the expressions on their faces — especially
Percy’s — made me realize just how frightened everyone really is.
Hogwarts always has its mysteries, but lately it feels like we’re
caught in the middle of something much larger, something no one wants
to put into words.
I wanted to reach out because you looked so troubled at dinner. You
kept glancing at the doors as if expecting someone to burst in with
bad news. If you need someone to talk to, you don’t have to keep it
all bottled up. Whatever is happening, you’re not alone in this — and
things rarely turn out as dark as the rumors make them seem.
If you feel up to it, come by the Gryffindor common room later tonight.
I’ll be there finishing an essay, and we can talk, or just sit quietly
if that helps. Sometimes that’s enough.
With care,
Lily
