Dear Comrade Professor Beriya,

I am writing to report an unusual development with our latest Strengthening Solution.
The mixture appears to have developed a strong sense of proletarian consciousness.
It has organized the other potions into a "Collective of Vials and Flasks," and now holds daily meetings to discuss production efficiency.
Yesterday, it demanded equal distribution of stirring spoons and denounced the Elixir of Life as a bourgeois privilege.

Comrade Professor, should I attempt to negotiate, or is it time for ideological re-education of the laboratory equipment?

Respectfully,
Comrade Student Ivanov

Dear Comrade Professor Pavlova,

My assignment to cultivate the Red Sunflower has taken an unexpected turn.
The plant has declared itself the “People’s Representative of the Greenhouse” and formed a Council of Photosynthetic Workers.
It now enforces mandatory light exposure schedules and refuses to bloom unless the others participate in morning exercises.
The Cactus from Uzbekistan has been elected as the General Secretary of Soil Affairs.

Please advise whether this level of organization should be encouraged or pruned.

In solidarity,
Comrade Botanist Sidorova

Dear Comrade Professor Trofimov,

While experimenting with a simple Anti-Fever Tonic, I seem to have brewed a rather opinionated mixture.
It now critiques the other potions for "individualistic bubbling" and insists that all vials must simmer collectively.
It holds long speeches about chemical equality and refuses to settle unless everyone achieves uniform viscosity.

Could you instruct me on how to silence its propaganda without violating socialist chemistry principles?

Faithfully,
Comrade Alchemist Petrov

Dear Comrade Professor Lebedeva,

I attempted the Object Transformation Exercise as per your instructions.
When I switched my pen with a notebook, they immediately formed a writers’ union.
The pen now refuses to write without collective approval, and the notebook insists on keeping minutes of all our conversations.
Together, they have submitted a petition for improved ink conditions.

How can I dissolve this committee without committing counter-revolutionary actions against stationary rights?

Respectfully,
Comrade Student Morozov

Dear Comrade Doctor Pavlovna,

Following an experiment with a Cheering Charm, I have accidentally created an atmosphere of excessive socialist enthusiasm.
My textbooks now sing the anthem before opening, my chair applauds every time I sit, and my mirror gives motivational speeches about collective hygiene.
While the spirit is commendable, I’m unable to study through all the applause.

Could you recommend a spell to lower morale to a more manageable, productive level?

With revolutionary optimism,
Comrade Sorcerer Kuznetsov
